        <h3>Overview</h3>

<p>After weeks or months of development and testing and lots of blood, sweat and tears, you release your Android app. A few days later, you see a comment about your app crashing in Google Play Store:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This app sucks. Constantly crashes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You then log in to the Android Developer Console for your app, hoping to get a little more detail. "Crashes. 0 new. 0 reports." Unfortunately, the user who experienced the crash didn't submit a crash report.</p>

<p>You're stuck.</p>

<p>Maybe you integrated the Google Analytics Android SDK to track your app's exceptions, so you check out the reports for your app. </p>

<pre><code>Can't create handler inside thread that has not called Looper.prepare()
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, that's all the detail you get. And it's happened six times in the last two days.</p>

<p>Maybe instead of Google Analytics you chose Flurry.</p>

<pre><code>class java.lang.RuntimeException
Msg: android.os.Handler.&lt;init&gt;:121 (Can't create handler inside thread that has
not called Looper.prepare())
</code></pre>

<p>Not much better. Where in your app is this occurring? You use a Handler dozens of places throughout your app.</p>

<p>You're stuck.</p>

<p>Enter Acracadabra.</p>

<p>Acracadabra is a Rails app that receives <a href="https://github.com/ACRA/acra">ACRA</a>-generated crash reports from Android applications and passes them directly to your email inbox. What's ACRA?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...a library enabling Android Application to automatically post their crash reports to a GoogleDoc form. It is targetted to android applications developers to help them get data from their applications when they crash or behave erroneously.</p>

<p>[It] can be used with your own self-hosted report receiver script.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Acracadabra is a fast-pass to your own "self-hosted report receiver script."</p>
