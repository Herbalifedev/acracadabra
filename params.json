{"body":"### Overview\r\n\r\nAfter weeks or months of development and testing and lots of blood, sweat and tears, you release your Android app. A few days later, you see a comment about your app crashing in Google Play Store:\r\n\r\n> This app sucks. Constantly crashes.\r\n\r\nYou then log in to the Android Developer Console for your app, hoping to get a little more detail. \"Crashes. 0 new. 0 reports.\" Unfortunately, the user who experienced the crash didn't submit a crash report.\r\n\r\nYou're stuck.\r\n\r\nMaybe you integrated the Google Analytics Android SDK to track your app's exceptions, so you check out the reports for your app. \r\n\r\n```\r\nCan't create handler inside thread that has not called Looper.prepare()\r\n```\r\n\r\nYes, that's all the detail you get. And it's happened six times in the last two days.\r\n\r\nMaybe instead of Google Analytics you chose Flurry.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass java.lang.RuntimeException\r\nMsg: android.os.Handler.<init>:121 (Can't create handler inside thread that has\r\nnot called Looper.prepare())\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot much better. Where in your app is this occurring? You use a Handler dozens of places throughout your app.\r\n\r\nYou're stuck.\r\n\r\nEnter Acracadabra.\r\n\r\nAcracadabra is a Rails app that receives [ACRA](https://github.com/ACRA/acra)-generated crash reports from Android applications and passes them directly to your email inbox. What's ACRA?\r\n\r\n> ...a library enabling Android Application to automatically post their crash reports to a GoogleDoc form. It is targetted to android applications developers to help them get data from their applications when they crash or behave erroneously.\r\n\r\n> [It] can be used with your own self-hosted report receiver script.\r\n\r\nAcracadabra is a fast-pass to your own \"self-hosted report receiver script.\"\r\n\r\n[Check it out](https://github.com/livefront/acracadabra).
